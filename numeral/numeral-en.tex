\epigraph{The total number of minds in the universe is one.}{Erwin Schr√∂dinger}

Numbers appear everywhere in our daily life. For example, this news: \enquote{\textit{The 2024 Paris Olympic Games to an end on Sunday August 11, 2024. Paris is the second city, after London, to host the Summer Olympics three times. It set a record of gender equality, with 5,250 male and 5250 female athletes. In total, 32 sports and 329 events were featured, with 206 countries and regions participating. Four new sports made their debut: skateboarding, surfing, sport climbing, and breakdancing. A total of 329 gold medals were up for grabs. Athletes from various countries and regions demonstrated outstanding athleticism. The United States and China tied for the most gold medals, with each securing 40. The United States also led in silver medals with 44 and bronze medals with 42.}} It contains 14 numbers among the total of 120 words. We don't know who invented the numerals because they show up in almost all historic documents to the very early time. Some believe numerals arose with language. Anthropologists identified numbers inscribed in bones, stones, caves, clay, etc. We can also find such clues in our languages, for example in English, eleven comes from `endleofan', meaning (ten) left one; twelve comes from `twelf', meaning left two.

There is a famous object in room 4, the British museum. It's the Rosetta stone, a broken inscribed stela with the length of 112cm, the width of 76cm (\cref{fig:rosetta-stone-recons}). One can identifies some Greek characters like \cref{fig:rosetta-greek} (see \cref{tab:greek-alphabet} of Greek alphabet) in the bottom, while the remaining are mystery ancient characters. When read them carefully, there are two different types: a curved form as in \cref{fig:rosetta-demotic} in the middle of the stone, and some small pictures as in \cref{fig:rosetta-hieroglyphs} on the top.

The discovery of the Rosetta stone was during the expedition when Napoleon Bonaparte campaigned in Egypt from 1798 to 1701, aimed to establish a colony in Egypt and to threaten British possessions in India. The French troop had about 3,800 soldiers, a fleet of 326 ships, and 167 most distinguished scientists and scholars directed by mathematician Gaspard Monge\cite{Harrison-2023}. This gave the expedition a scientific purpose, to conduct research and show off scientific advances. The fleet secretly sailed from Toulon, and lucky by-passed the British Royal Navy's detection in thick fog. Napoleon's army captured Alexandria on 2 July, then set out for Cairo. On 16 July 1799, Some French soldiers accidentally discovered the Rosetta stone when digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of Rosetta in the Nile Delta. It had apparently been built into a very old wall. Although the stone was broken, it was an important discovery. The officer sent it to the Egypt research center founded by Napoleon in Cairo in August. It was named after Rosetta, the discovered place. After the French surrender of Egypt in 1801, it passed into British hands. The stone was shipped to England and arrived in Portsmouth in February 1802. It is now in the British Museum in London.

What makes this stone important is its inscription. It's a decree in three different scripts: Hieroglyphs (suitable for a priestly decree), Demotic (the cursive Egyptian script used for daily purposes, meaning `language of the people'), and ancient Greek. It's about the affirmation to the royal cult of the 13 years old Ptolemy V on the first anniversary of his coronation (in 196 BC), saying he inherited the legitimate throne from his father, Ptolemy IV, and carried out many good deeds, such as donating to temples, exempting taxes, and so on. The rulers of Egypt at this point were Greco-Macedonian after Alexander the Great's conquest\footnote{Ptolemy I, a Macedonian general of Alexander the Great, became the ruler of Egypt in 305 BC. He founded the Ptolemaic dynasty which last for 275 years.}. The Macedonian king of Egypt was also the pharaoh, hence the decree was inscribed in ancient Greek as the official language besides Hieroglyphs and Demotic. It was copied on to large stones, which were put in every temple in Egypt.
