This project is to collaboratively draft the popular science book, _a tour of number_. The book targets to present the historic introduction to numbers. As a central notion in mathematics, it connects varies of theories. We are going to introduce interesting stories and great mathematicians along with the history of numbers. We plan to release the book in both English and Chinese by 2027. We'll draft in Chinese first, then follow with the English version.

Contents

- Preface
- Chapter 1, **Ancient time** Multiple ancient civilizations, including ancient Babylonia, ancient Egypt, and ancient China, developed the notion of number independently. People abstracted the number from concrete things.

You may use [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/liuxinyu95/algoxy) to build the PDF book from cloud desktop. (It takes about 15 ~ 20 min to build the workspace at the first time, while [later access](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) is quick.) For local build, you need TeXLive. We use LuaLaTeX, an extended version of TeX. Please refer to [INSTALL](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY/blob/amathtour/INSTALL.md) for detail.
