This project is to collaboratively draft the popular science book, _a tour of number_. The book targets to present the historic introduction to numbers. As a central notion in mathematics, it connects varies of theories. We are going to introduce interesting stories and great mathematicians along with the history of numbers. We plan to release the book in both English and Chinese by 2027. We'll draft in Chinese first, then follow with the English version.

Contents
--------

- Preface
- Chapter 1, **Ancient time** --
  Multiple ancient civilizations, including ancient Babylonia, ancient Egypt, and ancient China, developed the notion of number independently. People abstracted the number from concrete things.
- Chapter 2, **Zero** --
  Ancient Indian people developed the notion of zero. How did people reject, debate, and finally accept it.
- Chapter 3, **Numeral system** --
  Brief typical numeral systems, including ancient Babylonian (60 basis), Roman, and ancient Greek. Show how language influenced numbers. Introduce the widely used Hindu-Arabic (positional decimal) numeral system; why it has advantage in calculation. The story of _Fibonacci_. Counting rods and abacus in ancient China as numeral system tools. Binary numeral system, Leibniz, and computer.
- Chapter 4, **Negative number** --
  The confusion and debating about negative number; how did people accept negative number. Explain why 'Two negatives make a positive'. Model the negative number through a tuple (a, b) by van der Waerden.
- Chapter 5, **Ratio and Fraction** --
  Presents how people developed fraction. Egypt fraction. How unify the arithmetic rules with fraction. Fraction as a typical example that extends numbers. Fraction, decimal, and repeating decimal.
- Chapter 6, **Everything is number** --
  **(a). Pythagoras**. the mathematician and philosopher in ancient Greece; the school of Pythagorean. **(b). Number, shape, and music.** Figurate numbers and some sequences. How Pythagoras developed the theory of music through numbers, hence believed _everything is number_. **(c). Number and geometry.** Straight edge and compass construction.
- Chapter 7, **Irrational number**
- Chapter 8, **Real number**
- Chapter 9, **Complex number**
- Chapter 10, **Algebraic number**
- Chapter 11, **Numbers with structure**
- Appendices and answers

Install
--------

You may use [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/liuxinyu95/algoxy) to build the PDF book from cloud desktop. (It takes about 15 ~ 20 min to build the workspace at the first time, while [later access](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) is quick.) For local build, you need TeXLive. We use LuaLaTeX, an extended version of TeX. Please refer to [INSTALL](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/amathtour/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for detail.
