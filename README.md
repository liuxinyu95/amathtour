This repository contains the text of the popular science book, _A Tour of Numbers_. The book provides a historical introduction to numbers. As a central notion in mathematics, numbers connect various areas of theory. This book includes 38 interesting stories and biographies of great mathematicians in the history of numbers. There is **zero content generated by AI**; all content is 100% human-written. We completed the Chinese edition (中文) in October 2025 ([PDF file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22880853/amathtour-zh-cn.pdf)) and plan to release both the English (preview [PDF](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24872063/amathtour-en.pdf)) and Chinese editions by the end of 2026.

Contents
--------

- Preface
- Chapter 1, **Numeral systems** \
Covers numeral systems in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Rome, China, and Maya. Shows how language influenced numbers. Introduces the widely used Hindu–Arabic (positional decimal) numeral system and explains why it has advantages for calculation. Briefly introduces the binary numeral system and computers.
- Chapter 2, **Zero** \
Introduces the notion of zero in ancient India and how people rejected, debated, and finally accepted it. Covers confusion and debates about negative numbers and their acceptance. Explains why "two negatives make a positive" and presents how to model negative numbers as pairs of natural numbers.
- Chapter 3, **Fraction** \
Pythagoras music tuning and fractions. Egyptian fractions; the Babylonian base-60 fractional system; arithmetic rules of fractions in ancient China. Indian fractions and the fraction bar symbol. Fractions and decimals, including repeating decimals. Extension of numbers with fractions.
- Chapter 4, **Irrational** \
**(a) All is number.** The Pythagorean school. **(b) Pythagoras's theorem.** Various proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. **Number theory.** Pythagorean triples, perfect numbers, Fermat numbers, and Mersenne numbers. **(c) Irrational.** Irrational numbers from geometric constructions. **(d) Euclidean algorithm.** The Euclidean algorithm and its relation to irrational numbers and continued fractions.
- Chapter 5, **Real** \
**(a) Geometric constructions.** Arithmetic of geometric constructions. Coordinate geometry and geometric construction.

- Chapter 6, **Complex number** \
**(a) Cubic equation.** Geometric and algebraic solutions to quadratic and cubic equations; the emergence of imaginary numbers in cubic equations. **(b) Meaning of complex numbers.** Geometric interpretation and the Argand diagram. Algebraic interpretation as a pair of real numbers by Hamilton. The fundamental theorem of algebra. **(c) e.** History of e and its definition as a limit. Euler's identity and the relation between e and the logarithmic spiral. **(d) Regular Pentagon.** Geometric construction of the regular pentagon with complex numbers.
