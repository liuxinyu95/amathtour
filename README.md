This project is to collaboratively draft the popular science book, _a tour of numbers_. The book targets to present the historic introduction to numbers. As a central notion in mathematics, it connects varies of theories. We are going to introduce interesting stories and great mathematicians along with the history of numbers. There is **zero content generated by AI**, but 100% by human. We plan to release the book in both English and Chinese by 2027. We'll draft in Chinese first (and release the [PDF file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21557361/amathtour-zh-cn.pdf) for preview), then follow with the English version.

Contents
--------

- Preface
- Chapter 1, **Numeral system** \
    Typical numeral systems of ancient Egypt, ancient Babylonia, ancient Rome, ancient China, and Maya. Show how language influenced numbers. Introduce the widely used Hindu-Arabic (positional decimal) numeral system; why it has advantage in calculation. The story of _al-Khwarizmi_ and _Fibonacci_. Method of counting rods as a calculation tool in ancient China. Binary numeral system and computer.
- Chapter 2, **Zero** \
  Ancient Indian people developed the notion of zero. How did people reject, debate, and finally accept it. The confusion and debating about negative numbers; how did people accept negative numbers. Explain why 'Two negatives make a positive'. Model the negative number through a tuple (a, b) by van der Waerden.
- Chapter 3, **Fractions** \
  Fraction and Pythagoras music tuning. Egyptian fractions; Babylonia 60 based decimals; Arithmetic rules of fractions in ancient China. Indian fractions and fraction bar. Fractions and decimals, including infinitely cyclic decimals. Fraction as a typical example that extends numbers.
- Chapter 4, **Irrationals** \
  **(a). All is number.**, The school of Pythagorean, Figurate numbers, how Pythagorean believed _all is number_. **(b). Pythagoras's theorem.** Proofs to the Pythagoras's theorem. **Number theory.** Pythagorean triples, perfect numbers, Fermat numbers, Mersenne numbers. **(c) Irrationals.** Irrationals from the straight edge and compass construction. **(d). Euclidean algorithm.** Euclidean algorithm and irrationals, continued fractions.
- Chapter 5, **Reals** \
  **(a) Geometric construction**, Arithmetic of geometric construction. Coordinate geometry and geometric construction. Regular polygon construction. Gauss-Wantzel theorem. **(b) Pi**. Pi in ancient time. Geometric approximation. Binomial theorem. The fundamental theorem of calculus. Series. Leibniz formula. Lambert's proof that Pi is irrational. **Reals.** Eudoxus's proportion theory. Dedekind cut.
- Chapter 6, **Complex numbers** \
  **(a) Solving equation**. Varies of ancient civilizations developed solution to quadratic equation. Italian mathematicians broke through cubic and quartic equations and encountered intermediate imaginary solution. **(b) The fundamental theorem of algebra**. Story of Gauss, constructed 17-gon at age of 17. Example of pentagon with straight edge and compass. Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra in four ways in his life. **(c) Radical solution**. Quintic equation and Abel-Ruffini theorem; Galois theory and abstract algebra.

You may use [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/liuxinyu95/algoxy) to build the PDF book from cloud desktop. (It takes about 15 ~ 20 min to build the workspace at the first time, while [later access](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) is quick.) For local build, you need TeXLive. We use LuaLaTeX, an extended version of TeX. Please refer to [INSTALL](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/amathtour/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for detail.
